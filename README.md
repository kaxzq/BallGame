# Interactive Ball Simulation

## Project Description
This interactive ball simulation allows users to engage with a dynamic environment where they can manipulate balls in a resizable graphical window. 

- **Dynamic Interaction**: Users can drag balls around the window, merging them into larger balls by overlapping.
- **Resizable Graphical Window**: A flexible window where balls bounce off edges, utilizing collision detection for realism.
- **Varied Visuals**: Balls of varying sizes and colors enhance the visual experience, bouncing within the window.
- **User Input**: Control the simulation with mouse clicks to add or remove balls, and keyboard inputs to adjust ball speed.
- **Physics** (Optional): Incorporate basic physics principles, including gravity and friction, to affect ball movement.

## Specifications

### Input

- **Mouse Clicks**: Add new balls at the location of the click. Clicking on an existing ball may trigger merging.
- **Keyboard Inputs**: Use specific keys for actions (e.g., space bar to add balls, 'R' to remove all balls).
- **Mouse Drags** (Optional): Change the trajectory or position of balls manually.

### Output

- **Graphical Window**: A visual display of bouncing and interacting balls, with feedback on collisions and merges.
- **User Interface Elements** (Optional): Enhance control over ball behavior and settings with UI elements like buttons, sliders, or menus.
